     <h1> The Third "R".</h1>
   </div>
   <p class="intro">The Third “R” goal is to educate the public and those who wish to contribute towards a more sustainable environment on why recycling is so important in our present life and for the future. The consequences of not recycling is not just a problem for one single nation but a global issue that is often overlooked in everyday life. Below are some locations where you can drop off your recycling for free.</p>

    <div class = "para1">
      <p class="one"> 1) Recycling helps protect our environment! By recycling our old products into new and convenient products less waste is being sent to landfills equalling to less rubbish being buried in the ground, saving tons of carbon emissions from being sent into the air. Our landfills are accumulating waste at an alarming rate leading to some landfills being overflowed not only leading to air pollution but, leading to cities near oceans polluting the water with that overflowed waste creating pollution in our oceans. Not only are our oceans being affected but our soil is being contaminated as well,  which in turn is impacting the quality of our groundwater negatively. Equally as important, just as we as human beings need clean groundwater so do our local ecosystems. </p>

    <div class="para2">
      <p class="two">2) It has been proven that by taking the action to recycle our products, people and business industries alike can use those to recycle products and turn them into energy. By mining and processing raw metal from scratch for energy it uses a large number of resources and energy, however, if we recycle our metals not only are we conserving that energy used from getting materials from scratch we are also saving money. By recycling aluminium, we can save up to 95% of energy.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="para3">
      <p class="three"> 3) By taking the action to recycle it will have a huge economic benefit by helping to create jobs in the recycling and manufacturing industry in the United States. If we all contribute to recycling our materials then the demand for recycling plants will be elevated. More recycling plants creates more employment opportunities.</p>
